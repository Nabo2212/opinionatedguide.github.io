## Automated Building

## Debugging

### Software Debugging

[TODO]

GDB with Gef, interpreted languages, embeded systems, non-code isssues (boot problems, glitchy behavior), hardware failures, valgrind, various trace programs, print debugging extended

### Debuggers

[GDB Frontend](https://github.com/rohanrhu/gdb-frontend)

[GDB + GEF](https://gef.readthedocs.io/en/master/)

#### Static Analysis

[CodeChecker using LLVM/Clang (GitHub)](https://github.com/Ericsson/codechecker)

### Hardware Dubugging

common interfaces, simulation, serial/print debugging (slow), internal data logging, physical indicators of internal state, hardware to facilitate debugging (LED 'byte')

## Testing

### Software Testing

### Hardware Testing

## Automated Building and Testing

[TODO]

Fuzzing (sandsifter), make and alts, etc.

## Continuous Integration

## Continuous Deployment
