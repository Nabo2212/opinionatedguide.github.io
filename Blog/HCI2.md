5) Switchable "user profiles" instead of "user accounts", which are an artifact of giant shared computer systems. User profile just contains personalized settings and can be located anywhere, including removable media so you can take yours to other computers. If you want to keep things safe from others, encrypt them. Otherwise there are no permissions except those applied to applications themselves.

6) Sound *and video* should be routable like you see in DAWs. Plug outputs into inputs, add filters, split, mix, etc. This is of course scriptable so you can make it do what you want on arbitrary events.

7) Backwards compatibility should be a high priority, but accomplished via shim layers and/or emulation and/or vms when clean breaks are necessary. A wide array of such should be included with the OS from the beginning. In 2020, there is no excuse for not being able to run old software."
