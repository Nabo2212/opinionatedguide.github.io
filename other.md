# Other cool things that I want to promote but don't fit elsewhere so I'm making this list here:

* [Brimestone Valley Mall](https://podcastaddict.com/podcast/2486564)

  > The year is 1999. Lurking somewhere between Hot Topic and the food court, five misfit demons from Hell kill time inciting sin in a suburban shopping mall. When the lead singer of their band goes mysteriously missing, the demons only have two weeks to find him before they play the biggest gig of the millenium - or face the wrath of Satan herself.

* [17776](https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football)

  > I, uhh, don't know what to tell you what this is...
